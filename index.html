                Cyberstalking is the use of the internet and other technologies to harass or stalk another person online. This type of online harassment, which is an extension of cyberbullying and in-person stalking, can take the form of text messages, e-mails, social media posts, and other forms of communication, and is frequently methodical, deliberate, and persistent. When it comes to cyberstalking, perpetrators use a variety of tactics and techniques to harass, intimidate, humiliate, and control their victims. In fact, many cyberstalkers are technologically astute as well as creative, coming up with a variety of ways to torment and harass their targets.

                When it comes to preventing cyberstalking, it's critical to take the necessary precautions to protect yourself online. Although there is no way to completely prevent cyberstalking, there are steps you can take to increase your security and reduce the chances of it happening. Firstly, in order to protect yourself from cyberstalking, it's important to practice good digital hygiene. This means that you're aware of the digital footprints you're leaving online and are taking precautions to protect your accounts and identity. Also, to avoid cyberstalking, make sure your devices and online accounts are as secure as possible.

                On the 22nd of January 2022, Northern Caribbean University in Manchester became aware of a breach in their security system. Hackers have encrypted accounting and other files and are demanding payment for their release. The matter was reported to the Communication Forensic & Cyber Crime Division as well as the Counter Terrorism and Organized Crime Investigation Branch, according to an internal NCU statement. The Counter Terrorism and Organized Crime Investigations Branch is led by Superintendent of Police Anthony Mclaughlin. He said that hackers are asking for millions of dollars in ransom.

                An employee raised the alarm after finding the ransomware. Ransomeware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.
                According to Buckley, director of corporate communications, marketing, and public relations at NCU, some administrative processes were affected, like accounting and basic working files to get work done were made inaccessible. He added that the external backup for those files also failed.
